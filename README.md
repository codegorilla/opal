## Opal Programming Language

A statically typed programming language that compiles to C++.

Opal aims to be provide significantly nicer syntax than C++, fixing many of
the language's syntax warts; while retaining virtually identical semantics.

The updated syntax, while being substantially improved, still falls squarely
into the "curly-bracket" family of languages. This, combined with the fact that
it uses the same semantics as C++, means that the language will feel very
familiar to developers who already know C++.
